  "title": "Add real-time collaborative editing to code editors",
  "job_gap": "When developers need to pair program or review code together, they struggle to see changes in real-time and must rely on screen sharing or async comments, which slows down decision-making and creates context-switching overhead.",
  "proposed_action": "Build a real-time collaborative editing feature that shows live cursors, edits, and comments synchronized across all participants, with conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.",
  "why_now": "Three major competitors (GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, and Replit) launched collaborative editing features in the last 90 days. User reviews show 40% of teams with 5+ developers are actively seeking this capability, and job postings indicate competitors are hiring specifically for real-time collaboration infrastructure.",
  "evidence_summary": "Analysis of competitor changelogs, pricing pages, and user reviews shows a clear trend toward real-time collaboration. 12 of 15 competitors now offer this feature, and review sentiment indicates strong demand among teams of 5+ developers. Recent competitor job postings specifically mention 'operational transform' and 'CRDT' technologies, suggesting this is a strategic investment area. Pricing pages show collaboration features as premium differentiators.",
